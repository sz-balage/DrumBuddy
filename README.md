## About The Project

**DrumBuddy** is a cross-platform desktop application built for drummers who want to record, analyze, and improve their rhythm.  
It allows users to record their beats onto a **digital sheet**, get **real-time feedback**, and **store their ideas** for future practice or composition.

One of DrumBuddy‚Äôs core features is the ability to **compare two sheets**:
- Use one as a _base sheet_ (your intended rhythm)
- Use another as your _played performance_  
‚Üí The app then provides feedback, helping drummers identify mistakes and improve their timing.

It‚Äôs designed to work with **any electronic drum kit**, with **customizable MIDI mappings** for flexible compatibility.
> NOTE: The app has limited drumming functionality, as for now it can only record in 4/4 time signature, and the smallest division unit is a 16th note.

> üéì This application also serves as my **Bachelor‚Äôs thesis project**

### Built With

DrumBuddy is 100% C#, leveraging modern cross-platform and reactive technologies:

* [AvaloniaUI](https://avaloniaui.net/) ‚Äî for building the cross-platform UI  
* [ReactiveUI](https://reactiveui.net/) & [System.Reactive](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive) ‚Äî for declarative, reactive programming  
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) ‚Äî lightweight embedded database for sheet persistence  
* [ManagedBass](https://github.com/ManagedBass/ManagedBass) ‚Äî audio & MIDI library for handling drum input, and metronome audio playback

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### ü™ü Windows
1. Download the latest `DrumBuddy-win-x64.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/baluka1118/DrumBuddy/releases)
2. Unzip the archive
3. Launch `DrumBuddy.Desktop.exe`
   - Windows Defender may block it ‚Äî click **‚ÄúMore Info ‚Üí Run Anyway‚Äù**

#### üêß Linux
1. Download the latest `DrumBuddy-linux-x64.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/baluka1118/DrumBuddy/releases)
2. Unzip it
3. Navigate into the unzipped folder, and make the executable runnable:
   ```bash
   cd linux-x64
   chmod +x DrumBuddy.Desktop
4. Now you can run the app via terminal or file manager

#### üçé macOS 
For the time being, due to a lack of a paid developer certificate, you can only run DrumBuddy on macOS by manually signing it yourself.
##### Silicon 
1. Download the latest `DrumBuddy-osx-arm64.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/baluka1118/DrumBuddy/releases)
2. Run the disk image and drag the app to the Applications folder
3. Open up the terminal, and navigate to your Applications folder
4. Execute the following commands:
   ```bash
   sudo xattr -cr DrumBuddy.app
   sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine DrumBuddy.app
   sudo codesign --force --deep --sign - DrumBuddy.app
5. Now you can run the app
The app will ask for your permission to access the documents folder, in order to store exported app related data.
##### Intel
Use the same commands as above, but with the DrumBuddy-osx-x64.dmg build.

## Usage
After installation:
- Connect, and select your electronic drum kit (or try out the app via keyboard input)
- Configure your MIDI mappings in the Configuration section
- Create new sheets either by recording your beats, or creating them manually
- Compare sheets to see the difference

## Roadmap
- [ ] Multiple time signatures, and note division (1/32, triplets, sextuplets)
- [ ] MIDI, and MusicXML export/import 
- [ ] User management, and cloud sync

Any feature requests, and feedback is welcome and appreciated. (https://github.com/sz-balage/DrumBuddy/issues)
