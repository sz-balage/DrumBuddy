## About The Project

**DrumBuddy** is a cross-platform desktop application built for drummers who want to record, analyze, and improve their rhythm.  
It allows users to record their beats onto a **digital sheet**, get **real-time feedback**, and **store their ideas** for future practice or composition.

One of DrumBuddy‚Äôs core features is the ability to **compare two sheets**:
- Use one as a _base sheet_ (your intended rhythm)
- Use another as your _played performance_  
‚Üí The app then provides feedback, helping drummers identify mistakes and improve their timing.

It‚Äôs designed to work with **any electronic drum kit**, with **customizable MIDI mappings** for flexible compatibility.

> üéì This application also serves as my **Bachelor‚Äôs thesis project**

### Built With

DrumBuddy is 100% C#, leveraging modern cross-platform and reactive technologies:

* [AvaloniaUI](https://avaloniaui.net/) ‚Äî for building the cross-platform UI  
* [ReactiveUI](https://reactiveui.net/) & [System.Reactive](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive) ‚Äî for declarative, reactive programming  
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) ‚Äî lightweight embedded database for sheet persistence  
* [ManagedBass](https://github.com/ManagedBass/ManagedBass) ‚Äî audio & MIDI library for handling drum input, and metronome audio playback

## Roadmap
- [ ] Multiple time signatures, and note division (1/32, triplets, sextuplets)
- [ ] MusicXML export
- [ ] User management, and cloud sync
